expected flips to get one head is 2
where k is the amount of heads in a row

En = n consecutive heads
En - 1 means that if we get 1 more head we have n heads
or if it is a tail then we have to repeat.

E[n+1] = 1/2(1+ E[n]) + 1/2(1 + E[n] + E[n+1])

E[1] = 2
E[2] = 6
E[3] = 14
E[4] = 30
E[n+1] = 2 + 2E[n]

else draw to 0

E(X) = (1/2)(1) + (4/7)(1/2)(1) + (4/6)(4/7)(1/2)(1) + (4/5)(4/6)(4/7)(1/2)(1) + (1) + (1) + (1) + (1)
